Image Sources

The Sysdig CLI scanner can load images from different sources. By default, it will try to automatically find the provided image name from all supported sources, in the order specified by the following list. However, you can explicitly select the image source by using the corresponding prefix for the image name:

file:// - Load the image from a .tar file
docker:// - Load the image from the Docker daemon (honoring DOCKER_HOST environment variable or other Docker configuration files)
podman:// - Load the image from the Podman daemon
pull:// - Force pulling the image from a remote repository (ignoring local images with same name)
containerd:// - Load the image from Containerd daemon
crio:// - Load the image from Containers Storage location"
}
