# RT - scheduling
# I was excited to see that Mutter 3.34 can experimentally give itself a realtime priority 29. Iâ€™ve had a lot of situations where a rogue app or userspace process has managed to lock up my desktop system completely. After one of these I resolved to enable the rt-scheduler feature and see if it helped. And what do you know - it does!
