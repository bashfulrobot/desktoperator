Next Steps:

1.  **Deploy Updated Functions:** Run your Ansible playbook to deploy the latest version of `pake-wrapper.fish` to your system. This will include the fixes for `--icon` URL handling and the Brandfetch API key usage.

2.  **Set Brandfetch API Key:** Add your Brandfetch API key as an environment variable in your Fish shell configuration. Open `~/.config/fish/config.fish` and add the following line (replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual key):
    ```fish
    set -x BRANDFETCH_API_KEY 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
    ```

3.  **Restart Terminal:** Close and reopen your terminal to ensure the new functions and environment variable are loaded.

4.  **Run Icon Regeneration:** You can now run the `regenerate-pake-icons.fish` script. It should successfully fetch icons from both direct URLs and the Brandfetch API.
